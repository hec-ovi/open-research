some improvements, the loading of each agent, the box has roundedstuff, make the under of each rounder no rounded, so th eanimation line looks perfect.
the general research in progress animation does not goes to the end, it goes until plan only. the events must have a margin/padding or whatever a small separation. THE REST IS BEAUTIFUL! ans all working is a great job.
a big challange, when the finder bring links, show the links in the event as well as an event so that is more info.
The planner when adds querstions give it more format. also i got an error:
MissionControl.tsx:95 TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
    at ReportViewer (ReportViewer.tsx:143:79)


The above error occurred in the <ReportViewer> component.

React will try to recreate this component tree from scratch using the error boundary you provided, ErrorBoundary.
ErrorBoundary.tsx:31 ErrorBoundary caught error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
    at ReportViewer (ReportViewer.tsx:143:79)
 
{componentStack: '\n    at ReportViewer (http://localhost:5173/src/co…alhost:5173/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx:8:5)'}

AND in the sessions, when i click the sesison if is completed i should also open the result.

the footer, remove the v0.0.0 mit licence and leave the 3 things you put but centered, the backend, inference, and connection.
